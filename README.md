11.04.2024 -> Added component manual, wiring diagrams and / or other legal information.


A Polar - based 3D printer made form off-the-shelf parts.

Designed by Szilagyi Luca with the coordontaion of Maidan Alin.

All the files for the 3D Printable files are provided in the #DCAD folder with a full build fle coming soon.
This project requiered custom-made 3DPrinted Parts as well as custom crimped cables and configurable firmware based on Marlin.

!! The printer does have Thermal Runaway Protection but it's still a prototype so be aware of the riscs!
!! The system uses a 24V 12.4A Power supply. While the metal of the cable of the wires is not exposed, it's still dangereus!
